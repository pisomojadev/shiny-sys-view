## Description
This is a shiny dashboard used to track entity and entity metadata creation coming from AWS (oauth2) secured endpoints.  The entity model is used over various logging, scraping, and app designs I employ so this dashboard can be very quickly deployed to monitor those services/apps while in development.  For production dev-op use, this tool can easily be expanded using the api call and plotly templates provided.
